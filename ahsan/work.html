        I am currently a second-semester Computer Science student with an excellent academic record, consistently striving to excel in both theoretical knowledge and practical applications. Alongside my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, as well as a keen interest in web development and data structures. Beyond academics, I have honed my side skills in areas like problem-solving, teamwork, and time management, which I actively apply in group projects and coding competitions. I am also exploring emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning, aiming to broaden my expertise and contribute meaningfully to the field of computer science. My dedication to learning and growth drives me to balance my studies with skill development, preparing me for a successful career in the tech industry.
