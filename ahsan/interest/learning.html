        <p>I have a strong passion for coding and enjoy the creative and logical challenges it brings. I have completed an HTML course on Coursera, which has provided me with a solid foundation in web development. Through this course, I learned how to structure web pages effectively, use tags, and create user-friendly interfaces. This experience has fueled my interest in exploring more advanced topics like CSS, JavaScript, and front-end frameworks. I find coding to be both intellectually stimulating and rewarding, as it allows me to turn ideas into functional solutions. Continuously improving my skills, I am eager to take on more complex projects and expand my knowledge in the ever-evolving field of programming.</p>
